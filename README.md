I am currently working on a bunch of PyTorch tutorials. So far I have ones for [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis), [sequence-to-sequence learning](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq), [image classification](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-image-classification) and [part-of-speech tagging](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-pos-tagging). In the pipeline are tutorials on [reinforcement learning](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-rl) and [natural language inference](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-nli).

Other projects I have been working on are [Glyphs of Dialogue](https://github.com/bentrevett/glyphs-of-dialogue) and a PyTorch implementation of [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](https://github.com/bentrevett/recurrent-attention-model). 

I'm looking to collaborate on implementing some reinforcement learning papers. Contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ben_trevett) if you're interested.
